    <h4>A great introduction to pasta for kids – loads of fun to eat, 
        and a brilliant base for adding all kinds of other fresh ingredients. </h4>
        
    <ul><p><strong>Ingridients required</strong></p>
          <li>1 bunch of fresh basil</li>
          <li>1 medium onion</li>
          <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
          <li>1 kg ripe tomatoes , or 2 x 400g tins of quality chopped tomatoes </li>
          <li>olive oil </li>
          <li>1 tablespoon red wine or balsamic vinegar </li>
          <li>480 g dried wholewheat spaghetti </li>
          <li>15 g Parmesan cheese </li>
    </ul>
    <ol><p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
          <li>Pick the basil leaves onto a chopping board (reserving a few baby leaves to garnish), 
              then roughly chop the remaining leaves and finely chop the stalks.</li>
          <li>Peel and finely slice the onion and garlic. If using fresh, cut the tomatoes in half, 
              then roughly chop them or carefully open the tins of tomatoes.</li>
          <li>Put a saucepan on a medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil and the onion, 
              then cook for around 7 minutes, or until soft and lightly golden.</li>
          <li>Stir in the garlic and basil stalks for a few minutes, then add the fresh or tinned tomatoes and the vinegar.</li>
          <li>Season with a tiny pinch of salt and pepper, then continue cooking for around 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
          <li>Stir in the chopped basil leaves, then reduce to low and leave to tick away. Meanwhile…</li>
          <li>Carefully fill a large pot three-quarters of the way up with boiling water, add a tiny pinch of salt and bring back to the boil.</li>
          <li>Add the spaghetti and cook according to packet instructions – you want to cook your pasta until it is al dente. 
              This translates as ‘to the tooth’ and means that it should be soft enough to eat, but still have a bit of a bite and firmness to it. 
              Use the timings on the packet instructions as a guide, but try some just before the time is up to make sure it’s perfectly cooked.</li>
          <li>Once the pasta is done, ladle out and reserve a cup of the cooking water and keep it to one side, 
              then drain in a colander over the sink and tip the spaghetti back into the pot.</li>
          <li>Stir the spaghetti into the sauce, adding a splash of the pasta water to loosen, if needed.</li>
          <li>Serve with the reserved basil leaves sprinkled over the top and use a microplane to finely grate the Parmesan cheese, then sprinkle over.</li>
